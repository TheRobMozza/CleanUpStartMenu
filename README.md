# CleanUpStartMenu
My automated batch file script for automatically removing remnants from 3rd party updates when using WinGet


Customisation
-------------

Highly customisable, change display text, change colours, position of text, etc. You are hereby given my permission to modify this in anyway you see fit, just enjoy what you do!


Installation
------------

Ideally you can run this script on demand, or drop it into your Windows Startup folder so it runs everytime you load Windows.
